# Routerjs
router for jquery
Initially I am starting this project for providing routes in frontend like other framework(Angularjs,, Reactjs, Vue.js) but with a difference.
The user will be able to use it with JQuery and other JQuery plugins. It will provide simple, minimal and elegent solution for creating single page app using most loved library that is JQuery.
Beside routing,It will provide smooth transitions of pages. For most hybrid app development we need some smooth transition between pages. So no need to use other css library for transitions.
