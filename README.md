# Routerjs
router for jquery
Initially I am starting this project for providing routes in frontend like other framework(Angularjs,, Reactjs, Vue.js) but with a difference.
The user will be able to use it with JQuery and other JQuery. It will provide simple, minimal and elegent solution for creating single page app using most loved library that is JQuery.
